Of humble origins, the festival began in 1983 as a small, student-organized event that aimed to provide UCSD with a spring festival. In accordance with the San Diego climate, the 1st festival was rained out. Over the past 30 years, the festival has added student booths, vendor booths, three stages, art installations, and a campus-halting student atmosphere that is the envy of every college festival this side of the Rockies.",
